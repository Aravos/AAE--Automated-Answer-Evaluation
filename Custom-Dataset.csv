A convolutional layer applies one or multiple kernels (matrix) to an input vector/matrix (typically image) instead of connecting all single inputs of the input vector to the next layer with seperate weights. Instead in training only the kernel is updated. After a convolutional layer there is typicall a pooling layer. Given a window size it reduce the dimensional size of the output of the convolutional layer by using e.g. max or avg pooling. Afterwards the activation layer applies an activation function to the output of the pooling layer. In the end of a cnn there are typically some fully connected regular layers resulting in a softmax activation function, which assigns the probabilities to the classes output.","Convolutional Neural Network consists of many layers such as a convolutional layer that has kernels which convolve over the input image, an activation layer (ReLU activation), pooling layer (max or average pooling), and one or more fully connected layers followed by softmax layer."

So it is possible to backpropagate the error from the output layer to to first layer. A common Problem in BP is the vainshing gradient problem. Depending on the activation function used the local gradient gets smaller in each layer until it is eventually less than the floating point precision used. This limits the number of layers that can be stacked.",Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards.

5,"CNN has basically four types of layers. They are: convolutional layer, ReLU layer, Pooling layer and the fully connected layer. We can arrange the convolutional layer and ReLU layer in different ways. One of the ways is to have 1 convolutional layer, 1 Pooling layer, 1 ReLU layer and repreat this 3 layers again and then finally a fully connected layer. Another way is to have 1 convolutional layer, 1 pooling layer again repeat the convolutional and pooling layer and then 1 ReLU layer and finally fully connected layer. Convolutional layer is used to find the feature space.","Convolutional Neural Network consists of many layers such as a convolutional layer that has kernels which convolve over the input image, an activation layer (ReLU activation), pooling layer (max or average pooling), and one or more fully connected layers followed by softmax layer."
5,"CNN has three components, * Input * Convolution stage * Feed forward network In CNN the input pass through one or more convolution stage befor it is feed into a feed forward network. The convolution stage uses a hierarchical set of filters, RELU and polling to extract low level as well as high level concepts from the input. The feed forward network along uses the output of the convolution stage and back propagation is used to make adjustment to the network weights as well the filters in the convolution stage.","Convolutional Neural Network consists of many layers such as a convolutional layer that has kernels which convolve over the input image, an activation layer (ReLU activation), pooling layer (max or average pooling), and one or more fully connected layers followed by softmax layer."
5,"CNN learn on grid data (images, 3d volumes) using filters instead of matrix multiplication. Here, the filters are convoluted with the input in the Convolution layer per neuron, where we slide the filter (defined by fiter size $S\times S$) over the input with a stride (step size), and optional zero padding. Strictly speaking, since for RGB images we are working have three color channels, we work with volumes of filters (For example for RGB images of size $32\times 32\times 3$, a filter of window size $S=5$ has the dimensions $5\times5\times3$). Instead of learning a volume of weights for each convolution step, we share weights, considering that one feature detected in one part of the image may be of interest in another part. Then, we apply a nonlinearity, commonly the ReLu activation, as to introduce nonlinearity into our model. To reduce spatial size of our input, we can either use higher strided convolutional layers or pooling layers, for example the popular max pooling layer, where the maximum value over a subvolume is picked. These layers are then stacked, while in the last layers fully connected neurons are typically used to reduce data to for example a classification vector.","Convolutional Neural Network consists of many layers such as a convolutional layer that has kernels which convolve over the input image, an activation layer (ReLU activation), pooling layer (max or average pooling), and one or more fully connected layers followed by softmax layer."
5,CNN uses convolutional layers to extract primitive information from pattern. First data is convolved with the first layer to extract some features. Output of this layer is passed through RELU function to rectify it. Then is downsampled by pulling layer. It basicaly chooses only relevant outputs of convolution layer for further processing. RELU is chosen instead of sigmoid because it doesnt allow gradient to vanish in backpropogation.,"Convolutional Neural Network consists of many layers such as a convolutional layer that has kernels which convolve over the input image, an activation layer (ReLU activation), pooling layer (max or average pooling), and one or more fully connected layers followed by softmax layer."

5,In linear SVM we have a linear border line classifier that seperate two different classes(positive and negative planes) and we calculate the distance of the data points from this border line classifier. Also a margin will be defined and this margin will be maximized until it touches some data points in the plane. The data points that the margin pushed agains them will be our support vectors. The error for the wrongly classified datapoints will be calculated by calculating the distance of the data point from its correct plane. The SVM tries to learn the classifier and the margin from the training data.,SVMs are linear learnable machines in the simplest case. It uses a decision boundary with maximum margin to classify the data into different classes. The data points which are near the decision boundary are called support vectors and the margin is determined based on these points. Kernels are used to separate non-linearly separable data and the algorithm is solved by using Quadratic Programming. 
5,In multi layer ff networks the error is only available in the last layer. Therefore the error is propagated back through the network using the backpropagtion algorithm. In order to do so the local gradient has to be calculated. Update of the weight: w+1 = w + n * x * gradient where the iput x is the output of the previous layer. The local gradient is calculated diffrently depending if the neuron is in the output layer or in the hidden layer. Output layer: $ gradient = phi`(x) * (y -d) $ Hidden Layer: $ gradient = phij`(x) * SUM(wi * local gradienti) $,Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards. It back propagates an error from the last layer to the first layer by updating the weights. The updates are determined by the local gradient at each level which is computed by partial derivatives of the error and chain rule.

5,RBM is an unsupervised learning technique. It has visible neurons and hidden neurons. Neurons are in either +1 or -1 states. It uses the idea of simuilated annealing to flip the neuron states based on energy function and pseudo temperature. It operates in 2 states - clamped state and free flowing state. In clamped state only hidden neurons are flipped and in free flowing state both visible and hidden neurons are flipped. Weights are adjusted based on avergage correlation difference between all the neurons in clamped and free flowing state.,The reduced Boltzmann machine is a bi-parted graph which works by flipping the states of binary neurons based on a probability determined by the activation produced at the neuron.

One key innovation associated with SVMs is the kernel trick. The kernel trick consists of observing that many machine learning algorithms can be written exclusively in terms of dot products between examples. It allows us to learn models that are nonlinear as a function of x using convex optimization techniques that are guaranteed to converge efficiently. Besides, the kernel function k often admits an implementation that is significantly more computatinal efficient than naively constructing two vectors and explicetly taking their dot product.",SVMs are linear learnable machines in the simplest case.

5,The back propagation algorithim is there to train a mulilayer feedforward ANN. We change the weights by computing the local gradiant at each neuron by using the neurons in the layer befor. The local gradient of the output neurons can be computed easaly. The activation function has to be differantable for the backpropagation algorithm. In the forwart pass we compute the output y at the output layer. In the backard pass we use the output y and our desired output d to compute the local gradients at the output layer. Then we go back layer by layer and use the local gradients from before to compute the new local gradients. By that we minimize the average squared error function.,Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards. It back propagates an error from the last layer to the first layer by updating the weights. The updates are determined by the local gradient at each level which is computed by partial derivatives of the error and chain rule.
5,"The back propagation algorithm is based on the error correction learning rule and consists of two passes: 1. Forward pass : The input signal applied to the source nodes of the network is propagated forwards through the different layers of the network, and the output is computed at the output layer of the network. 2. Backward pass : The error signal computed at the output is propagated backwards, with a local gradient computed at each of the hidden layer neurons, in order to adjust the synaptic weightsof the neuron in the network.",Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards. It back propagates an error from the last layer to the first layer by updating the weights. The updates are determined by the local gradient at each level which is computed by partial derivatives of the error and chain rule.
5,The back propagation algorithm is used to calculate the error contribution of each neuron after a batch of data is processed. Required is a known desired output of each input value. Thus the back propagation algorithm is a supervised method. The algorithm can be subdivided into two phases: 1) Propagation: * Propagation forward through the network to generate the output value(s). * Calculation of the cost error term. * Propagation of the output activation back through the network usin the training pattern target in order to generate the deltas (differences between desired and actual output) of all output and hidden neurons / by recursevliy computing the local gradient of each neuron. 2) Weight update: For each weight the following steps need to be applied: * The weight's output delta and input activation are multiplied to find the gradient of the weight. * A ratio (percentage) of the weight's gradient is substracted from the weight. This ration is also referred to as the learning rate and influences the speed and quality of the learning. Learning is repeated for every new batch until the network performs adequately.,Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards.

First it is required to find a data point which are clossest to hyperplane, and these data points are called support vectors. Next task is to find a maximum possible width of the hyperplain such that support vectors are on the edge of that hyperplane. This problem is formulated as min-max constrained optimization problem. In order to find a optimum width of hyperplane, (optimimum of a funtction) the idea is to use method of Langrange multiplier. Additionally, when I data is not linearly separable, than an approach is to project data in higher dimension and then to find a hyperplane that separates data in that dimension.",SVMs are linear learnable machines in the simplest case. It uses a decision boundary with maximum margin to classify the data into different classes.

5,"The idea of back propagation method is to propagate error from ouput (final) layer backward to hidden layers, and adjust the weighs of neurond in hidden layer, based of this error. This is required because we do not have error information for hidden layers, only for output neurons. The error from output layer is propagated to hidden layers using idea from steepest descent method. Namely, local gradients are computed for each neuron in backpropagation, and these local gradients define how error changes, in terms of weights. Local gradients are derived from chain rule for each layer. The fact that local gradient for each hidden layer is derived based on local gradient of a previos layer, defines that as we propagate more and more in hidden layers of NN, the gradient of a error function vanishes, which means that as we go deeply back in NN, the change in weights is becominng smaller and smaller. This is a drawback of back propagation method.",Backpropagation lowers the error of a MLP level by level recursively backwards. It back propagates an error from the last layer to the first layer by updating the weights. The updates are determined by the local gradient at each level which is computed by partial derivatives of the error and chain rule.
5,"The idea of learning a network is to minimize a certain costfunction. We can use steepest descent to minimize this cost function.

It is also used in BP.",Steepest descent is used to update the weights in a NN during the learning phase. It helps to navigate the cost function and find the parameters for which the cost is minimum.

Higher learning rate, faster learning, but then learning is characterized by oscilations in searhc for min. This is dangerous because if learning rate, becomes bigger that a certain value, it can make search with steepest descent unstable.

",It makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.
5,When the inputs are being send into a network and we calculate the error we need a mechanism to learn and manipopulate the free parameters of the network and the learning uses the error but we must know in which direction in the search(optimization) space we should move so that we can reach the global minima of the error for this we use steepest decent. This method tells us in which direction we need to move by getting the gradient from the error.,Steepest descent is used to update the weights in a NN during the learning phase. It helps to navigate the cost function and find the parameters for which the cost is minimum. The weights are updated in the direction of the steepest descent which is in a direction opposite to the gradient vector. This method could suffer from local minima and may become unstable.

5,"When training a model on a limited training data set, we must decide wether we accept a biased model which makes assumptions about the test data, but has a better performance on the train data, or a model with more variance which might model the entirety of the data better but be prone to data noise. Usually we have to decide on a trade off between the two, where we may select well balanced models based on VC dimensions or Cross validation results.","Bias-variance dilemma is a principle supervised learning problem. The dilemma arises due to the variance of data and bias of model. When there is high bias, the model fits the training data perfectly but suffers from high variance, when the bias is low the variance reduces but the model doesn’t fit the data well. This dilemma makes the generalizability difficult to achieve."

5,"When using steepest descent the learning rate($\eta$) determines the speed at which the weihts are adjusted in the NN. There can be two possible danger related to leraning rate depending on its magnitude: 1. Low learning rate(eg, $\eta = 0.01$) results in smooth variation of the weights but makes the process becomes slow. 2. Hight learning rate (eg, $\eta = 0.01$) results in faster weight adjustment but it leads to an oscillatory nature in the learning which is unwanted.","Learning rate controls the speed of the convergence. When the learning rate is low, the convergence is overdamped and slow. When the learning rate is high, the convergence is underdamped and follows a zigzagging path.

5,"Widrow Hoff learning rule is also called as error corresction learning rule. The error is defined as the difference between the desired and the actua output of the learning machine. Assuming the desired signa is available, the error is computed and weights of the neural network are upadted in the direction of reduction of errors.

5,"Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations. ","First, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression."
